----(Title: Odyssey<br>

The content of this post is: [Begin]<p>Odyssey is another game from the FreeBASIC era, which I planned to be the successor to <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/land-of-stuff.html">The Land of Stuff</a>. Eventually I integrated its improved server into the Land of Stuff for its rehaul.</p>

<p>A sci-fi MMORPG, it reached the closed beta stage and is one of my only projects to break into the third dimension. I implemented the 3D engine from scratch using 2D line drawing, inspired by a QBasic pseudo-3D racing game which achieved bigger than life perspective effects.</p>

<h2>Red versus Blue</h2>
<p>In terms of game mechanics, Odyssey is also an oddity, featuring a combat system based on opposing red and blue forces, with a neutral gray. The world was split in this way, with each faction receiving its own weapons and resources.</p>

<p>Which side would you join?</p>
<h2>Toolbox</h2>
<p>Finally it was another step towards extensive tooling in my projects, from an EXP curve planner to a rule-breaker logger. Here's the EXP grapher:</p>

<h2>But Some Things Stay the Same</h2>
<p>Like most of my games it also featured multiple planet environments to launch to and explore. Adventure is everywhere.</p>[End])----
