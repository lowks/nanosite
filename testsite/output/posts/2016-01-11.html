<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Mister Man grew from a Christmas present for my twin friends Cary and Michael (<a href="http://htwins.net">htwins.net</a>). For holidays and birthdays, we would make elaborate zany projects to share with each other, from Sodoku comic books to computer games. Some of these were precursors to some of our biggest projects, from <a href="http://wanganzhou.com/archive/2015-10-12.html">The Land of Stuff</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24C8378F296DB656">Battle for Dream Island</a>.</p>
<p>Mister Man became an early exploration of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elaborate game characters</li>
<li>Vibing my musical compositions with game environments</li>
<li>Custom map editors for character scripting</li>
</ul>
