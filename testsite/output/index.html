It figures out an author\'s unique "word signature", which is the distribution of word frequencies in their writing. Based on this, it can take any piece of writing and figure out who wrote it!</p>\n<p>You can check it out on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/qema/author">Author</a>.</p>\n<p>Makes use of cool probability tools like <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/">Bayes\' Theorem</a>!</p>\n<p>How it works: we want to find out "What is the probability that author A wrote book X, if we know that X has a certain word composition?" It turns out that we can use Bayes\' Theorem to flip this around, into "What is the probability that X has a certain word composition, if we know that author A wrote the book?" Well, since we know the authors\' "word signatures", we already know how to do that -- all we have to do is tally up words! It seems like Bayes\' Theorem has the power to reverse causation! What will you do with your new superpower?</p>'}, 'sound-transfer': {'meta': {'title': 'Sound Transfer'}, 'content': '<p><img alt="Sound Transfer" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/sound-transfer/screenshot.png" /></p>\n<p>Sound Transfer is a system to send a message from your computer to a friend\'s with speaker and mic. It uses a melodic pitch-based protocol, which means you can hear your message converted into a musical ditty in the process!</p>\n<p>Check out the source code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/losmmorpg/sound-transfer">Sound Transfer</a>.</p>\n<p>Method: The outgoing message is converted into its binary ASCII representation, then converted to pitches with the melodic protocol. The receiver picks up the pitches with Fourier transforms and decodes from binary to ASCII text.</p>\n<p>Here\'s the protocol.</p>\n<pre><code>Pitch   Symbol  Meaning\n---------------------------------------\n1976 Hz  \'!\'    Begin transmission.\n1174 Hz  \'0\'    Send a binary 0.\n784 Hz   \'1\'    Send a binary 1.\n988 Hz   \'*\'    Used as a separator between repeated digits.\n1568 Hz  \'.\'    End transmission.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Wow!

You can check it out on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/qema/tie-dye">Tie-Dye</a>. Create and share your tie-dye creations with the world!</p>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p>The tie-dyes are generated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim\'s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm</a>, which is a really cool algorithm to connect the vertices of a graph, specifically creating a tree with shortest total edge length (or "weight"). It\'s used for anything from maze generation to circuit design.</p>\n<p>Here\'s how the Tie Dye works.</p>\n<p>We start out with the idea of turning our computer screen into a graph, with a vertex at every pixel.</p>\n<p><img alt="Graph it!" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph-empty.png" /></p>\n<p>We make a full grid connecting all vertices, assigning random weight to each edge.</p>\n<p><img alt="Connect" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph-full.png" /></p>\n<p>Next we use Prim\'s Algorithm to connect the edges in a tree. This gets rid of any loops in the graph. Now our computer tie dye will flow into new spaces instead of mixing with itself, just like water tension does for real tie dye.</p>\n<p><img alt="Prim It!" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph0.png" /></p>\n<p>Now, starting from a random point, we\'ll do a paint bucket fill on it (specifically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth First Search</a>). Except, ours will be a special rainbow paint bucket that changes color after each step, and can only flow along the edges.</p>\n<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph1.png" /></p>\n<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph2.png" /></p>\n<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph3.png" /></p>\n<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph4.png" /></p>\n<p><img alt="Flow" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/graph5.png" /></p>\n<p>Now we have a rainbow tie-dye pattern!</p>\n<p><img alt="Tie-Dye" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/tie-dye/tie-dye1.png" /></p>'}, 'shakespeare': {'meta': {'title': 'Dialogue Graphs'}, 'content': '<p>Click to inspect a node, or drag to move a node.

is a visualization of social networks in three Shakespeare plays, created with Python and <a href="http://visjs.org">vis.js</a>, using data from the <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu">MIT Shakespare collection</a>.</p>\n<p>Each vertex represents a character, and the edges connect characters who talk with each other. I did this by taking all the sets of characters on stage between each stage direction, and then merging these sets. This turns out to be a good heuristic because it breaks groups between character entrances and exits, and other stage directions simply cause redundant groups to form which get filtered during merging.</p>\n<p>The edges are modeled as physical springs with vis.js so clusters tend to form based on the emergent "cliques". Finally, the characters are colored in the graph by popularity.</p>'}}, 'template': {}, 'music': {'.ds_store': {}, 'covers': {'meta': {'title': 'Covers'}, 'content': '<p>I do covers of songs with voice, piano, violin and/or guitar.
